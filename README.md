## Overview

Meteoro is a beautifully designed, highly resilient weather application built with Next.js. It provides a comprehensive and visually intuitive weather forecast by intelligently sourcing and merging data from multiple APIs. Its modern interface adapts to the current weather conditions, and its robust backend architecture ensures high availability and transparent error reporting.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic UI & Theming**: The application background and theme dynamically change (from light to dark) based on the current weather conditions, creating an immersive user experience.
- **Comprehensive Weather Data**: Get all the information you need in one place:
  - Current weather with temperature, feels-like, high/low, and conditions.
  - Detailed hourly and 5-day forecasts.
  - Air Quality Index (AQI) and component pollutants.
  - UV Index with clear recommendations.
  - Sunrise and sunset times.
  - Wind status, gusts, and direction.
  - Atmospheric pressure and humidity.
  - Current moon phase.
  - Real-time weather alerts.
- **Robust Multi-API Architecture**:
  - **Resilient Data Fetching**: Aggregates data from both **WeatherAPI** and **OpenWeatherMap**.
  - **Intelligent Fallback**: If one provider fails to find a location, the system uses coordinates from the other to perform a secondary lookup, dramatically increasing reliability.
  - **Transparent Error Handling**: If data sources fail, the UI displays a clear, itemized list of all backend errors, so the user is never left guessing.
- **Modern & Accessible Design**:
  - Built with a focus on a clean, modern aesthetic using glassmorphism effects and a responsive layout.
  - Implements **A11Y standards** to be accessible to a wide variety of users.
  - Features interactive iconography and polished UI components for an intuitive experience.
- **Geolocation & Manual Search**: Automatically fetches weather for the user's current location or allows for manual searching of any city worldwide.
